# Recap: Brand archetype

## Brand what?

Brand archetypes are recognisable personalities. They’re relatable. People associate themselves with brands that match their own personality. They are the reason you buy Apple over Microsoft or Prada vs M&S. These brands all have different archetypes. You identify with a brand.

## Knowing yourself

People relate to us when they understand our brand. It is impossible to do that without choosing a brand archetype.
We need to know ourselves before we can convince others. Our archetype sets how we speak and what we speak about.

## So who are we?

We’re a mix:

- 60% Creator
- 40% Magician

## Our brand

### Creator

Creators make stuff. We build. We take nothing, and turn it into something. This fits well with design. UX is a process for building. It describes how we create.

Things Creators think
“Need to increase purchases? We can redesign the site to do that”
“HMW help Marketing teams coordinate with Producers in studios?”

Examples
If it can be imagined, it can be done. Ideas are grounded pragmatism.
Lego – A toy that helps people express themselves by building.
Apple – Pioneers of great tech.

### Magician

Magicians are similar to Creators. They both imagine possibilities. The difference is that magicians dream beyond what’s possible. They dream about what’s next. They imagine
This is a crucial part of 100 Shapes’ ethos. We need to imagine new ways of working. Things far into the future.

Things Magician think
“”

Examples
Sony – Tiny sophisticated electronics? That’s pure magic!
Disney – Obvious, right? It’s all about imagination and inspiration.

## Why are we doing this?

Distinct and steady personality and style of our brand.
If that’s the brand, we need to ooze that feeling in everything we produce.

We’re energising work for everyone. For that, you need two magical ingredients:

- Empathy
- Exploration

These are our values. They are what we look for with new team members. They are what we praise.

## Objectives

Identify what you do
Understand what differentiates you from your competition
Recognise you in the future
