Our strategy is to help others Energise work. Equip them with the ideas, tools and services to make a difference to the lives of their employees.

Our tactics describe how.

**Step 1: Publish how we operate**
Open-source our ideas so that other can discuss and imitate. This establishes ourselves as the thought-leaders of Energising work. 

**Step 2: Products & Services to Energise Work**
Give others the means of Energising Work through products and services. 
This is our "Energising Work eco-system". We are a commercial entity.This will sustain us while we grow.
