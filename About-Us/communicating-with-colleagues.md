## Where this comes from

Practicing clear communication has always been a priority - it helps us stay connected and aligned as a team.

Now that we are remote, we have had to make some slight adjustments to our communication strategy at 100 Shapes. Asynchronous communication is no longer a novelty, now, we embrace it.

## Communication Guides

**Assume positive intent**. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Explore the possibilities, hold back judgment. Stop and ask why before drawing conclusions.

**Think before you speak**. Be mindful of intentions versus impact. Think what you are going to say, put yourself in the receivers shoes, thinking about how they might receive the message, adjust accordingly and deliver with kindness and grace.

**Be generous with Feedback**. Never hold back from giving feedback, remind yourself of the benefit - it informs growth. We encourage each other to give feedback and receive feedback in a considerate way.

**Listen effectively**. This means concentrating, not interrupting or anticipating what the speaker means, focusing on feeling and reflecting back what you have heard nad understood.

**Forget formality, be human**. When in doubt, use an emoji. We are human, we are peers. We don’t need office jargon. Opt for casual communication.

Tech that helps us with communication

Slack. Slack is our default. It is where most of the communication happens at 100 Shapes. We have a channel for pretty much everything. Explore!

Tandem. Sometimes, for internal meetings, we don’t need to waste bandwidth on video so we use tandem - voice only.

Loom. Looms are great accompaniments to google docs or any written communication when talking asynchronously. That is where your body language, tone and energy can really come across to supplement the written message.

Google Docs. Mastering the written word has been particularly important during COVID-19 remote working. Write down intent, write down context, write down as much of your thinking as you can so the reader can stay aligned.

Communications tips

1.  Video calls. Turn on your camera as it will help other meeting attendees feel comfortable as they are certain to have your undivided attention. If you cannot turn on video for personal reasons or situations, give attendees a heads-up.
2.  Agenda. Always have an agenda prepped and send along with the invite. This shows that you care and have thought about how to maximise the time with your team.
3.  Take notes. And follow-up with everyone in the meeting. This way, no important information will be missed and it will help everyone bias towards action.

Embracing Asynchronous communication

This was novel now it’s the norm. Instant replies aren’t and shouldn’t be the expectation. If you need an answer right away, make a call.

1.  All written communication happens in google docs.
2.  Any team-wide announcements should be made on #chat on slack.
3.  You aren’t expected to be available all the time.
4.  Clearly state what response you are after and when you need then by.
5.  If something is urgent, call.
